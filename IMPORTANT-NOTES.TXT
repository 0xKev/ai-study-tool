TO SOLVE MKCERT HTTPS ISSUES:

COPY MKCERT CA ROOT TO .venv\Lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem

certifi is where the certificates are managed

REASONING:

When establishing a secure HTTPS connection, your Python client (using the QdrantClient
library) needs to verify the server's certificate to ensure it's genuine.

To verify the server's certificate, your client needs to trust the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued it. 
The error indicates that your system doesn't have the necessary 
CA certificates in its trusted certificate store to form a trust chain back to a known root CA

While mkcert does a great job of providing trust for locally issued certificates in web browsers, 
it seems it might not automatically install the
mkcert root CA into the certificate store used by Python and the QdrantClient library
